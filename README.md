In a world with plenty of content and choice, it becomes hard to concentrate on topics that
really matters to an individual. Be it news, movies, music, friends etc.
Today, I, Amogh MeƐhƌam͕ am ƚoo bƵƐǇ ǁiƚh mǇ ǁoƌk life ƚo ƐƉend ƚime on knoǁing ǁhaƚ͛Ɛ
happening around the world. I am very keen on world politics, new technologies and funny
memes. I was using Reddit to get some of my news on these topics.
After joining audibene, I realized my fellow colleagues also use reddit. Some of us are in
Berlin, Germany, some in Denver, Colorado, US, while others in Miami, Florida, US. We of
course like different reddit channels.
It would be awesome if we (users) can receive a personalized daily email newsletter at 8 am
containing top 3 most voted posts (within the last 24 hours) from our (ƚhe ƵƐeƌ͛Ɛ) favorite
sub-reddit channels.
